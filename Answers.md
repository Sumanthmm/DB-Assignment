1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.
Answer:
In the given schema, the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities have a relationship through the "category_id" attribute in the "Product" table. This relationship is established by linking the "category_id" in the "Product" table with the "id" in the "Product_Category" table.
The relationship represents an association between the products and their respective categories. Each row in the "Product" table with a specific "category_id" value corresponds to a category in the "Product_Category" table with a matching "id" value. This linkage allows you to connect products to their respective categories and organize them based on common characteristics or classifications.
In database terminology, this type of relationship is known as a foreign key relationship. The "category_id" in the "Product" table serves as a foreign key that references the primary key "id" in the "Product_Category" table, creating a link between the two tables. This connection enables you to retrieve information about a product and its associated category or vice versa by joining the relevant columns in the two tables.
