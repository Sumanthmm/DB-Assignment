1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.
Answer:
In the given schema, the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities have a relationship through the "category_id" attribute in the "Product" table. This relationship is established by linking the "category_id" in the "Product" table with the "id" in the "Product_Category" table.
The relationship represents an association between the products and their respective categories. Each row in the "Product" table with a specific "category_id" value corresponds to a category in the "Product_Category" table with a matching "id" value. This linkage allows you to connect products to their respective categories and organize them based on common characteristics or classifications.
In database terminology, this type of relationship is known as a foreign key relationship. The "category_id" in the "Product" table serves as a foreign key that references the primary key "id" in the "Product_Category" table, creating a link between the two tables. This connection enables you to retrieve information about a product and its associated category or vice versa by joining the relevant columns in the two tables.

2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
Answer:
The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities in the given schema is established through a foreign key relationship. Specifically, the "category_id" column in the "Product" table is linked with the "id" column in the "Product_Category" table.To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can enforce referential integrity through the use of foreign key constraints. Here are the steps to achieve this:
1.Define Foreign Key Constraint.
2.Ensure Valid Values.
3.Enforce CASCADE Actions.
By following these steps, you enforce referential integrity between the "Product" and "Product_Category" tables, ensuring that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it. If an attempt is made to insert or update a product with a non-existent category, the database will raise a foreign key violation error, preventing the inconsistency of having products without valid categories.
